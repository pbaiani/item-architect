# PF2E: Triocks Item Architect

Take full control over your campaign's loot with the Item Architect, a professional-grade procedural forging hub for Pathfinder 2e. Designed for GMs who need more than just random tables, this module allows you to build custom items from the ground up using a powerful "Rule Element" engine. Whether you are crafting a simple +1 longsword or a legendary artifact, you can stack detailed, modular rules to define exactly how an item behaves. With its intuitive drafting UI and strict whitelist controls, Triocks Item Architect turns item generation into a precise, creative process, ensuring every piece of loot feels unique, balanced, and perfectly suited for your world.

**Modular Rule Stacking**: Layer multiple properties, runes, and custom logic onto a single base item.

**Procedural Forging**: Rapidly generate items that adhere strictly to PF2e math and rarity whitelists.

**Drafting UI**: Preview and "Architect" your items in a dedicated workspace before committing them to your world.

**Foundry v13 Ready**: Built with modern Vanilla JS logic to ensure high performance and stability in the latest Foundry environments.
